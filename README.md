#kayeilsql

This unassuming work “Kaye is Learning SQL”, comprises of my notes on SQL, and teaches basic SQL. It is written in html and is free of charge, available in GitHub Pages. Although my starting point is; “let more girls/women/females have tech roles”, these notes of course 😊 can be of use to anyone who want to learn SQL.

SQL which is short for Structured Query Language, is a data access and data processing language for relational databases. SQL has been around for nearly 50 years and it is the most widely used database language. Even today, SQL is used in Cloud technologies, Google Cloud Platform’s BigQuery is an example. 

Being a widely used and a very popular database language, a huge number of SQL tutorials and trainings by many creators, as well as documentations of big vendors like Oracle and Microsoft, exist on the web.
These tutorials, trainings and documentations on SQL are all easily accessible.

What sets apart my work (“Kaye is Learning SQL”) from all the existing tutorials and documentations on the web, is its “Sample Tables” and the “Data Model behind the Sample Tables”. 
The “Sample Tables” data and the “Data Model” of this text are based on the European Parliament, and it comprises of the Political Groups, Members of the Parliament as of 2004 Elections over 27 EU Countries, which lasted until the 2009 elections.

The information I took the data from, is open to public and can be reached at the European Union websites below:

https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en

https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/

https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en

https://op.europa.eu/en/web/who-is-who


I designed the Data Model which is in 3NF (Third Normal Form) using the information in these EU websites. I gathered data on the Political Groups, Members of the Parliament, Committees, Delegations, Countries of the MEPs, from the resources listed above.
However, there is also some fictitious data which I mention at the beginning of each chapter.
I made up that fictitious data, to be able to teach some SQL concepts.

There are two sample database creation scripts in GitHub Repositories, which create the tables and their relationships, and then insert the data into the tables; one for an Oracle Database, and another for Google BigQuery, as the dialect slightly differs.

If you are using a Cloud Platform, and if you do not want to use the creation scripts, the data of these tables are also available as CSV files, which can be used directly to create the tables with data in them. As I am only familiar with the GCP (Google Cloud Platform), I created these tables in BigQuery and then the CSV files from the tables.
Subsequently, for those willing, Google Looker Reports can be created on these tables.

I wish you all the best; health, courage, hope, and strength and the will to go after your dreams.
